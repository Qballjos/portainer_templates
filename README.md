# New Ubuntu Server Setup Instructions - Prep



Commands to prep your system:

  If you want to Install Glances: 

  * sudo glances -w

  Install and test Docker:

  * sudo apt install docker.io

  * sudo systemctl enable docker

  * sudo systemctl start docker

  * sudo systemctl status docker

  Setup Portainer: 

  * sudo docker volume create portainer_data

  * sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce




** Further Ubuntu Setup items to be Added at a Later Time: **

   1. Adding a public SSH Key to your Server 

   2. Mapping a Network Share for Container Access (Media/Library Files on a NAS, Backup Locations, etc)

   3. Remapping a Share at Server Boot



In the Browser Setup: 

  You Should now be able to navigate to the IP of the VM or Ubuntu Machine, going to the portainer port 9000  http://IPADress:9000

  Do initial Portainer registration 

  Configure Endpoint Setting so that the IP is set to that of the Host (basically, set the IP to the same thing you used to connect) 
      - Click Endpoints, then click the name of your VM/Server, and adjust the IP in the noted space

  Adjust your app template list to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mycroftwilde/portainer_templates/master/Template/template.json
      - Click Settings, then adjust the App Template URL, and Apply the Changes. Afterword, navigate back to the app templates and the list should refesh to be pulling from this repository
